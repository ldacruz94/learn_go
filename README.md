# Learn Go

### About

This project documents my journey as I learn the Go programming language, inspired by the book ["The Go Programming Language (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series)" by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan](https://a.co/d/378GUMw). 

The repository includes my personal notes, interpretations, and original code examples based on concepts discussed in the book. All content here is my own work, created to reinforce my understanding of the material.
